TURN YOUR PHOTOS INTO BEAUTIFUL WORKS OF ART ON PAPER

Picoala equips you with a comprehensive set of tools to prepare, organize, and arrange multiple photos on pages using both automatic and manual layouts, and easily AirPrint and Share the results in PDF, TIFF, JPEG, and other formats.

LAY OUT AUTOMATICALLY

Discover the ease of automatic photo arrangement and positioning, saving you time and ensuring optimal layout results. Choose from Auto, Grid, or Collage layout modes and let the app handle all the layout work for you.

EDIT AT EVERY LEVEL

Explore three distinct levels of in-app content editing:
- Project Level. Offers mostly global and automatically applied settings, well suited for updating the entire project and page.
- Page Level. Allows to make layout and content editing of any single page, perfectly suited for layout adjustments and photo resizing.
- Photo Level. Provides tools to modify any single photo, including crop, flip, and rotation.

JUGGLE INDIVIDUAL & GLOBAL SETTINGS

Streamline your workflow by applying the proper settings at the right moment:
- Use Global settings when you need to apply the same adjustments to all photos and pages.
- Use Individual settings when you need to make changes to a single photo or page.

The app offers both options for most settings, like page size, margins, photo size, border, de-squeeze, and more.

CREATE STUNNING COLLAGES

Choose the most suitable collage from a diverse collection of commonly used templates when Collage layout mode is selected.
Edit selected collage pages to make them truly unique and outstanding by using collage-specific tools, including resize, split, merge, swap, and more.

ADD A TOUCH OF DECORATION

Enhance your pages by customizing the background color and adding up to three background images, allowing each page to reflect your unique style.

Make your photos truly stand out by applying a border to each photo, specifying desired color, width, and relative position.

MANAGE MULTIPLE PROJECTS

Create, modify, and switch between an unlimited number of in-app projects to organize your photos for specific tasks, making them easily accessible for editing and printing.
