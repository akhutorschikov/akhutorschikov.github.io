            <h2>Cancel Subscription</h2>
            <p>A subscription in our app is a purchase made through the App Store on your iOS device. Apple provides a standard process for managing and canceling subscriptions. You can find instructions in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039" alt="Apple's official documentation">Apple's official documentation</a>.</p>
            <p>The cancellation process ensures that you won't be charged for the subscription beyond the current billing cycle, while still allowing you to enjoy the subscription benefits until the end of the current period.</p>
